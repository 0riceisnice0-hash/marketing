          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Get in touch and tell us about your business. We'll ask about your services, target customers, and any specific features you need. This can be a quick call, email exchange, or WhatsApp chat - whatever works for you.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Based on what you've told us, we'll create a draft version of your site. This shows the layout, design style, and basic structure. It won't have all your final content yet, but you'll get a clear picture of what the finished site will look like.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Timeframe:</strong> 3-5 working days for template sites, 5-7 days for custom designs

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Take your time to review the draft. Share it with your team. Get feedback. If you're not happy, no problem - there's no obligation to proceed. If you like the direction but want changes, we'll discuss what's possible.
          </p>

            <strong>Timeframe:</strong> As long as you need - no pressure

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Once you've decided to proceed, we'll refine the design based on your feedback. We'll add all your final content, images, and make any adjustments. You'll have the opportunity to review again before launch.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We'll get your site online, connect your domain, and show you how to make basic updates if you want to manage it yourself. We'll provide documentation and are available for any questions as you settle in.
